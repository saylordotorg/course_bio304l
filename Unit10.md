**Unit 10: Urinary Physiology** <span id="10"></span> 
*This lab reviews the chemical (e.g. glucose and protein levels) and
physical (e.g. color and pH level) characteristics of urine and
identifies potential abnormalities.  You will learn how to perform
urinalysis, a clinical diagnostic tool used to analyze urine.  This lab
explains how you should read and interpret the results of the
multistix/urine strip as part of the urinalysis procedure.  *

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please watch the first video clip (about 5 minutes)
    to learn about urinalysis.  This video reviews the physical and
    chemical characteristics of urine as well as abnormalities diagnosed
    by this test.  “Urinalsysi Part 1” (about 10 minutes) explains how
    urinalysis test results can be obtained by observing the colors of
    the urine strip.  The third video (about 40 seconds) demonstrates an
    actual test using urine and a strip.

     Instructions: Please read through this page (excluding the
    “Microscopic Exam” section) to learn about the procedures,
    methodologies, and interpretations of urinalysis.  You will learn to
    test for various chemical and physical characteristics of urine
    using Multistix.  This activity also explains how to interpret
    results to form clinical diagnoses.
