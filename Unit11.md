**Unit 11: Digestion** <span id="11"></span> 
*This section reviews laboratory tests demonstrating the digestion
processes of carbohydrates (starch, glucose, sucrose), proteins (e.g.
egg whites), and lipids (e.g. vegetable oil).  You will also learn about
the roles that the digestive enzymes and the pH play in these processes.
 *

**Unit 11 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 6 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please watch the first video (about 3.5 minutes) to
    learn about the digestion of starch using iodine and amylase.  The
    second video (about 1.5 minutes) demonstrates the Benedict test used
    to test for glucose, and the third video clip (2.50 minutes)
    presents a test for sucrose in the presence of HCl or NaOH and
    Benedict’s reagent.
