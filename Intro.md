Course Syllabus for "BIO304L: Human Physiology Lab"
---------------------------------------------------

This lab course supplements [BIO304: Human
Physiology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio304/).  Although we cannot
virtually replicate the lab experience, this “lab” will familiarize you
with scientific thinking and techniques and will enable you to explore
of some key principles of human physiology. The material in this lab
supplement relates to the material covered in the lecture and reading
portion of the course.  While the lecture and reading portion focuses on
big-picture concepts, here we will focus more on visual understanding,
manipulation, and practical use of your knowledge.  You will review the
physiology of the organ systems by using images of models, experiments,
and videos.  Then you will be asked to assess your knowledge, which
eventually can be put to practical or experimental use. Co-requisite:
[BIO304: Human Physiology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio304/).
