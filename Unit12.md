title: "BIO304L: Human Physiology Lab"
course_description: "An introduction to physiology that uses various activities and exercises to explore the subject. Lab topics include: enzyme activity, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), reflexes, blood pressure and heart rate, blood typing, spirometry, urinalysis, digestion of carbohydrates and proteins, and sea urchin embryology."

**Unit 12: Reproduction** <span id="12"></span> 
*Using sea urchins, the lab in this unit demonstrates the release of egg
and sperm cells following an injection of KCL.  You will also learn
about the process of fertilization: using a microscope, you will observe
how only one sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell.  *

**Unit 12 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: The first video clip (about 2 minutes) reviews sea
    urchin fertilization.  The second clip (1 minute) briefly overviews
    a sea urchin experiment involving the extraction of sperm and egg
    cells and fertilization.  “Sea Urchin Egg Extraction” (about 6
    minutes) demonstrates how to inject KCL into a sea urchin in order
    to promote the release of eggs.  The last video (10 seconds) depicts
    how sperm “attack” and consequently fertilize an egg.

     Instructions: Please review this lab to learn about the extraction
    of egg and sperm cells from sea urchins using KCL injections.  You
    will also learn about egg fertilization using a sperm suspension and
    a microscope.  The microscopic image, which depicts the
    fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell, is a still from the “Sea
    Urchin Fertilization” short video linked above.
