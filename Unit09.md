title: "BIO304L: Human Physiology Lab"
course_description: "An introduction to physiology that uses various activities and exercises to explore the subject. Lab topics include: enzyme activity, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), reflexes, blood pressure and heart rate, blood typing, spirometry, urinalysis, digestion of carbohydrates and proteins, and sea urchin embryology."

**Unit 9: Respiratory Physiology** <span id="9"></span> 
*This lab reviews the definitions of “tidal volume,” “inspiratory” and
“expiratory” reserve volume, and “vital volume.” This unit also explains
how to measure these volumes using a spirometer and presents various
respiratory diseases and their effects on lung capacity.  *

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please review pages 66 through 68, to learn about the
    objectives of the ventilation experiment.  Then read pages 74
    through 81 to learn about the tools and procedures involved in this
    analysis, and, lastly, fill out the worksheet based on the estimated
    data learned in the Web Media presented below.

     Instructions: Please watch the first video (about 5 minutes) to see
    images of a spirometer and learn about the process of spirometry. 
    The second video clip, “Lung Capactiy Spirogram” (about 2 minutes),
    reviews the volumes produced by the ventilation process.  Lastly,
    please click the third link and choose the “Respiratory” Module and
    work through the sections starting with “Spirometry” and ending with
    “Diseases”.  These pages are interactive; please check your
    estimated answers.  Through practice, you can observe how lung
    capacities change once conditions are changed.
