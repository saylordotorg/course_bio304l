**Unit 4: Electromyography (EMG)** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this section, you will learn about electromyography (EMG)—the
process by which the electrical activity of muscle is measured—using
specific software called Biopac.  You will learn all about how to use
Biopac, including how to attach the electrodes to muscles and how to
record and interpret data.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

-   **Assessment: Bluegrass Community & Technical College: “Biopac:
    Electromyography Lab” and “Biopac Electromyography Worksheet” and
    Biopac Science Lab: “EMG”**

     Instructions: Review the first link to learn about EMG procedure
    and set-up. Open the second PDF to estimate results and answer the
    questions presented in the lab. In the last link read pages 8
    through 9 for an introduction to Biopac’s tools and information on
    how electrodes are attached. Lastly, check the answers and estimated
    data results you provided in “Biopac Electromyography Worksheet”
    against the Answer Guide on pages 42 through 45.
