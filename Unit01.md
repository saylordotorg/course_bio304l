**Unit 1: Introduction to Scientific Investigation** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This unit focuses on applied methods for scientific inquiry.  You will
learn how to make observations and predictions, formulate hypotheses,
design experiments, and obtain and present data.  This unit will also
assist you in identifying dependent and independent variables in a
hypothesis. *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

-   **Reading: Kean University: “Application of the Scientific Method”
    and Pennsylvania University: “Scientific Investigation”**
    Link: Kean University: “[Application of the Scientific
    Method](http://samson.kean.edu/~breid/scimeth/sci_meth.html#SCIMETH)”
    (HTML) and Pennsylvania University: “[Scientific
    Investigation](http://www2.lv.psu.edu/jxm57/irp/sci_inv1.html)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: For the first link, please read the section
    “Introduction to the Scientific Method.”  For the second link,
    please read the “Overview” and “The Question” through “The
    Scientific Paper.”  These materials explain how to design a
    scientific experiment and define terms such as “hypothesis,”
    “control experiments,” and “dependent” and “independent” variables. 
    The readings will also teach you about the main elements involved in
    scientific writing, including abstracts, introductions, methods,
    results, and conclusions.
