**Unit 5: Patellar and Plantar Reflexes** <span id="5"></span> 
*This lab demonstrates how a patellar reflex (knee jerk or tendon
reflex) and a plantar reflex are tested.  You will learn about the
muscles and nerves involved in these reflexes and how the presence or
absence of these reflexes may indicate a neurological problem.  *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 2 hours to complete.

     Instructions: “The Tendon Reflex” (about 6 minutes) provides
    background information on the patellar reflex, including the muscles
    and nerves involved in the movement.  The second video, “Infant
    Reflexes” (about 4.5 minutes), shows the reflexes that are supposed
    to be present in a healthy infant, including the Babinski reflex. 
    “Babinski reflex positive” (5 seconds) demonstrates a Babinski
    reflex in an adult that indicates a neurological problem. 
    “Pattellarreflex” (about 1.5 minutes) demonstrates how to perform
    the patellar reflex test, and “Babinski Reflex” (about 2 minutes)
    demonstrates how to perform the plantar reflex test.
