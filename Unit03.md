**Unit 3: Electroencephalography (EEG)** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this section, you will learn about measuring the brain’s electrical
activity, a process called electroencephalography, or EEG.  This lab
reviews the different types of brain waves using specific software
called Biopac.  You will learn all about Biopac, including how to attach
the electrodes to a subject’s head and how to record and interpret
data.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please first read “EEG: Introduction” for an overview
    of EEG and brain waves.  Then read the second link, “EEG,” to learn
    how to record EEG activity.  To open the PDF, click on the second
    link called “BioPAC Teachers\_Guide.pdf.”  Pages 3 through 5 of this
    second link describe the electrodes and their placement; pages 12
    through 13 explain the objectives and experimental procedures; and
    pages 50 through 53 walk you through the experiment itself and the
    data collection (this final section also includes an Answer
    Guide).
