**Unit 2: Enzyme** <span id="2"></span> 
*This section will review the role of enzymes in catalyzing chemical
reactions in our bodies.  In this lab, you will learn about the factors
that modify enzyme activity.  Using a turnip extract containing the
enzyme peroxidase, we will demonstrate the effects that modulators—such
as temperature, pH, and inhibitors—have on this enzyme.  *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please review these three video clips (about 10
    minutes in total) to watch the step-by-step procedure of this
    experiment, including how to prepare the turnip extract and how to
    measure the effects of different temperatures and pH levels on the
    enzyme activity.  You will find the experiment’s objectives and
    procedures in the next resource box.

    Instructions:  Please review this activity to learn about the
    objectives and the procedures of the experiment you watched above. 
    Then, based on your knowledge of the enzymes and their modified
    activity by modulators, please record what results you would expect
    when conducting the temperature, pH, and inhibitor experiments.
