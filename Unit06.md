**Unit 6: Electrocardiography (ECG)** <span id="6"></span> 
*This section reviews electrocardiography, or ECG, which is the process
by which the heart’s electrical activity is measured using Biopac, the
software you learned about earlier in this course.  *

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours to complete.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: In the first link, “Introduction,” please read
    through the page and then roll your mouse over “Electrocardiogram”
    in the upper left-hand side menu.  From there, please read “Setup,”
    “Electrocardiogram Basics,” and “Electrocardiogram Experiments.” 
    This material reviews the basics of ECG, the setup of the tools, and
    the recording and interpretation of ECG activity.  In the last link,
    to open the PDF, click on the second link called “BioPAC
    Teachers\_Guide.pdf.”  Please review “Biopac Science Lab: ECG,” for
    an introduction to the tools and information on how electrodes are
    attached (pages 6, 10, and 11), and then check your estimated data
    and the answers to the questions posed in the prior two links
    against the Answer Guide (pages 46 through 49).
